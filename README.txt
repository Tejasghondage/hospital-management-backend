How to Run This Project

Set up the database
Create database:

sql
CREATE DATABASE hms_db;


Edit database username/password in:


src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml


Set your MySQL credentials here:


<property name="hibernate.connection.username">root</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.password">root</property>
